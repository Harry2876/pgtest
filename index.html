The area has been inhabited since the Mesolithic-Chalcolithic period, with tribal communities such as the Santhals, Mundas, and Oraons being the main inhabitants. It was part of ancient empires like the Mauryan and Gupta dynasties and saw the rise of local kingdoms such as the Nagvanshi and Chero dynasties during the medieval period. Under British colonial rule, Jharkhand became a center for tribal uprisings, including the Santhal Rebellion (1855-1856) and the Munda Rebellion (1899-1900) led by Birsa Munda. After independence, the demand for a separate state grew, leading to the formation of Jharkhand in 2000. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since its creation, Jharkhand has faced political instability and challenges like the Naxalite insurgency.

They use their hands, cloth. or kharat (a wooden tool) to smooth out.The effect created from the use of hands defines the authenticity and subtle beauty of this folk art. For the making of mud wall painting for sohrai painting kali matti, dhudhi matti, pilla matti, laal mitti is prepared. For this the mud is crushed and grinded and then mixed and soaked in water. After some time it is filtered out making a very smooth mixture of all the naturally extracted pigments.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">THE CHANGE IN THE PRE PRODUCTION METHOD</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While working with naturally extracted pigments the same method is done to prepare the colors. Earlier even the handmade paper is also made by the artisan for which the process of handmade paper is also involved in the pre production process. When the canvas is a handmade paper ,binders are added to the prepared paste in the proportion of 1:3 approximately. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With modernization and change in materials and tools natural pigments are replaced by the acrylic color which is easily available and can be used for working on different materials. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">PRODUCTION METHOD </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SOHRAI WALL PAINTINGS</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Traditional method of inscribing motifs on mud walls starts with the process of applying dudhi matti using the technique of half moon strokes the busera (bas, bamboo, era, goddess) using their hands. The use of hands creates an authentic background known as comb effect which adds value to the art. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They use (black soil) kaali mitti &nbsp;to make the contour lines for the motifs. The next steps involves the addition of laal and pilla matti in which they dip the kuchi or datwan and make the painting, by applying the liquid earth colors directly on the clay walls which immediately soak up the paint like a sponge.Pieces of cloth are at times used as brushes by dipping them in color.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another layer of outline from kaali matti is coated over the for more defined lines. Some artisans use dots used as highlights using dudhi matti.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SOHRAI PAINTING ON PAPER</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The same method is also done while making it on the paper but the choice of use of natural or artificial paints depends upon the artisan. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With natural pigments mixed with binders is used and paste is prepared before the application on the handmade paper.Handmade paper is used mostly because of its thickness which allows for pigments to stay on the paper. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The comb effect is done as the initial step by the use of laal or dudhi matti depending on the background type and the significance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Black color strokes are directly drawn when the first layer dries by the artisan using natural or artificial pigments. The use of pencil </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">drawn motifs bring more intricacy and precision for the paintings. Use of brushes made it easy for artisans to make more contemporary designs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The same process is then repeated after it as done on wall painting.With the application of colors of red and yellow and then another layer of black outline is coated. White dots is used as a highlights feature which beautifies the artwork. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SOHRAI PAINTING ON OTHER SURFACE</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Acrylic paint and brushes are used on the other surface.

The motifs used in these paintings are deeply connected to nature, fertility, and the cycle of life. Practiced by different communities residing in different villages, each village has a distinctive style of painting, and the motifs used in each painting vary from place to place and community to community. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Common motifs in Sohrai painting include:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Elephants: Symbolizing strength and wisdom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Peacocks: Representing beauty, grace, and fertility. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Snakes: Often associated with life and renewal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Horses: Symbolizing power and speed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cows: Considered sacred and associated with abundance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Trees: Representing growth and life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flowers: Symbolizing fertility and beauty. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sun and moon: Representing cosmic balance and cycles of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Circles, squares, and triangles: Symbolizing the universe and its elements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Other common representations of Khovar art are females with their young inside the womb and scenes of struggle between man and animal.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">EVOLUTION AND STYLIZATION</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While folkloric core essence remains rooted in classical traditions, style has evolved and subtle but important changes have been made over time. By simplifying sophisticated patterns to accommodate the constraints of contemporary spaces and time.Featuring flexibility in exploring spaces,colors are also set in bright, vibrant colors such as appealing blues and greens for contemporary aesthetic alternatives. With the rise in demand and modernity, motifs are increasingly incorporated into new designs,leading to new interpretations and stylizations.For adaptation to mass production, leading to a certain degree of standardization and loss of individuality. Differences in scale, complexity, and composition are seen in the highly polished and precisely outlined sculptures. Sohrai and Khovar&rsquo;s bespoke designs reflect a delicate balance between preserving tradition and adapting to modern influences. This evolution ensures the sustainability of the art form while keeping it relevant for a modern audience.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CRAFT</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">CULTURAL</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sohrai art celebrates a healthy crop and plentiful livestock, as well as family and society. It is prepared during the sohrai festival, which honors animals as a source of prosperity and fertility. The cattle are bathed, decorated, and provided special food on this occasion. In keeping with tradition, they use natural soils to paint patterns of animals and plants. The paintings provide riches and protection to the family and crops.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The art is a mash-up of symbols, motifs, and pictures that are linked to both prehistoric rock art and tribal ancestral tradition of Hazaribagh and its surrounds.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nature is the source of ancestral spirits for the tribals. It is for this reason that ancestral spirits are revered. and favored in all of their forms</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The cattle in Sohrai art is noteworthy because tribals believe Lord Ram brought back domesticated wild cattle as well as herds of line for milk and oxen for plowing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SOCIAL</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of these traditions is the painting of the Kohvar and Sohrai traditions, which a mother (or aunt) passes on to her daughter, who in turn learns the typical forms of her mother-in-law&#39;s house. Matriarchal implications greatly impact women&#39;s roles in tribal society. Tribal society follows the ancient human tradition of the Earth Mother, in which women are regarded as mothers. Thus, a woman&#39;s Khovar background is her birthright, and creation is both natural and holy to her. This is the cornerstone of Hazaribagh&#39;s Khobar painting heritage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As proved by women artists on multiple occasions, art is the flowering of individual brilliance in a collective, aesthetic, and emotional tribal consciousness. The tribal women are inspired by the enormous natural forces surrounding them and create stunning paintings representing Khovar birds, animals, and fish. The bride leaves her mother&#39;s home and is welcomed into her husband&#39;s household from the Khovar room. She carries the designs she learned from her mother and aunts in the hamlet with her. Her mother-in-law teaches her patterns unique to her husband&#39;s village. As a result, the flood of design shapes continues to flow. Not only a joyous and grateful holiday, Sohrai is also a means of conserving and developing a rich artistic legacy that shows the creativity and talent of tribal women Sohrai is also a time for socializing and cultural events. The tribal communities perform folk dances and sing various songs to express their gratitude to nature and their ancestors.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">TYPES OF PRODUCTS</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With exploration of creativity of new artisans and with help of certain knowledge provided to these creative hands many contemporary motif products are seen in the market where people appreciate touch of traditional and classic values with modern aesthetic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each piece is often a labor of love, with artisans paying close attention to detail to create visually stunning products.
